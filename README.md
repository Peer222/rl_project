# Sustainable Optimization of the Electricity System
This repository contains an approximate implementation of the current power supply technology used in germany and lets the agent optimize the composition of the technologies used with regards to system stability, production costs and carbon emissions.


## Installation
```bash
git clone git@github.com:automl-edu/final-project-thepowerbandits.git
cd final-project-thepowerbandits
conda create -n rlenv python=3.11
conda activate rlenv

pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Contents

There are three different environments in src:
- BasicElectricityGridEnv
- AdvancedElectricityGridEnv
- ComplexElectricityGridEnv <- only **this** one is interesting

Environmential parameters can be found in `environment.toml`.

The main scripts are `train.py` and `visuals.py`.  
`train.py` provides a flexible way to train the agent.  
`visuals.py` provides an easy way to plot the most interesting data for logs generated by `train.py`.  
Both scripts show their options and default when using `--help`.

To reconstruct our evaluation runs, just run `evaluation.sh`. The corresponding plots will be saved in `visuals`.  
We haven't provided our final execution logs, as they are way too big (even when compressed).

## Minimal Example

Otherwise this is a basic training run:
```
python train.py --steps 200000 --logname basic_log --runs 5
python visuals.py --log_dir "./logs/basic_log/"
```
It will do 5 training runs with 200.000 steps and save its log in `./logs/basic_log/`.  
Plots can be then found in `./visuals/basic_log/`.
